todo
----
A cross platform todo list application for a range of CLIs.

Pre-Requirements
----------------
MacOS or Linux-based OS:

gcc 
make

Windows OS:
Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tools (C/C++)

Install
-------
MacOS or Linux-based OS:
Running make will create the debug build in the ./bin/ directory. It will also delete existing ./bin/ and ./pkg/ directories. 

Other options:

make release
make install (requires release build and sudo permissions)
make clean (deletes ./bin/ and ./pkg/ directories)
make debug (creates the debug build in ./bin/)

Windows OS:
Load the *.sln in Visual Studio, execute Debug or Release builds. I create a Todo folder in C:\Program Files and then move the .\x64\Release\todo.exe into C:\Program Files\Todo. Add C:\Program Files\Todo into your PATH variable.
